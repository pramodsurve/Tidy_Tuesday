## Week 19 Water Dataset

I concentrated on ggiraph and gganimate packages to create interactive
and animation for water points installed by country.

### Learnings

-   The graphs become too cluttered if there are many lines in
    gganimate. If not animated with gifski 100 png files are created.

-   For Brushing (ggiraph) the long labels on x and y axis makes the
    graphs too small and unreadable. Need to find a way to reduce the
    size of labels in the output.
